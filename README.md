# What is Blend

Blend is a framework enabling developers to build web and mobile applications.
It is written in TypeScript and requires TypeScript knowledge if you are going to
use it to develop applications.

Blend is a component based framework. It is built around the notion of stackable
components. Blend components can be stacked on top on each other or composed together
for building an application.
